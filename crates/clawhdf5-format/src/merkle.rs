//! Merkle tree implementation for chunk integrity verification.
//!
//! Supports SHA-256, BLAKE3, and KangarooTwelve (K12) hash algorithms.
//! Useful for verifying individual chunks without rehashing the entire dataset.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! This implementation uses:
//! - Domain separation (leaf prefix `0x00`, internal prefix `0x01`) to prevent
//!   second-preimage attacks
//! - Constant-time hash comparison to prevent timing attacks
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use clawhdf5_format::merkle::{MerkleTree, HashAlg};
//!
//! // Build tree from chunk data
//! let chunks: Vec<&[u8]> = vec![&[1, 2, 3], &[4, 5, 6], &[7, 8, 9]];
//! let tree = MerkleTree::from_chunks(&chunks, HashAlg::Blake3);
//!
//! // Generate proof for chunk 1
//! let proof = tree.proof(1).unwrap();
//!
//! // Verify the proof
//! assert!(tree.verify_proof(1, &chunks[1], &proof));
//! ```
