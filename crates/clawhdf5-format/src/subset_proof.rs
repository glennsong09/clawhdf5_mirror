//! Verifiable subset extraction (P1.5★).

//! Lets a recipient of an arbitrary hyperslab cryptographically prove that
//! the delivered chunks are a *complete and correct* subset of a signed
//! parent dataset: every delivered chunk is authenticated by a Merkle path
//! to the root, and a coverage certificate binds the exact set of chunk
//! indices that were extracted so that a silently omitted or substituted
//! chunk is detectable without the verifier needing to re-derive the
