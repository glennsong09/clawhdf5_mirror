//! The P2.4 white-box red-team attack suite (S2-D2-Yr2 §`sec:adversarial`).
//!
//! Every attack function follows the same shape mandated by the spec: open
//! (or build) a test HDF5-derived dataset, perform **one** targeted
//! modification using raw file/byte I/O (never a ClawHDF5 write API), then
//! call the verification API and assert the expected result.
//!
//! Attacks are split into two groups:
//!
//! - **Dataset attacks** (T1a, T1c, T1b, T2a, T2b, T2c, T6a, subset-a/b/c/d) run
//!   against the [`HarnessDataset`] — either the real GOES-18 file's actual
//!   on-disk HDF5 chunks, or the synthetic fallback — because they only need
//!   "a chunked Merkle-protected byte blob" and get more authentic coverage
//!   from real satellite chunk boundaries and filter-compressed sizes when
//!   available. T1a/T2a are the "easy" storage-tamper/bit-flip baselines;
//!   T1c (a valid-after-pipeline compressed-stream substitution) and T2b
//!   (a burst error) are the harder, directed-adversary variants
//!   §`sec:adversarial` explicitly calls for. T2c is a further directed
//!   variant that also patches the on-disk companion `tree_nodes` blob (not
//!   just the chunk) to match — the P2.4 red-team finding that
//!   `verify_dataset` didn't actually chain leaves to the root until fixed;
//!   see the doc comment on `t2c_directed_leaf_patch_forgery`.
//! - **Mechanism attacks** (T1d, T1e, T1f, T3, T4a, T4b, T5, T6b, T6c, T7, T8)
//!   target a specific primitive (the companion-integrity self-check, the
//!   leaf/internal hash domain separation, the signed-root binding, the
//!   provenance journal, the version counter, the AEAD leaf formula, the
//!   null-sentinel padding) that isn't meaningfully expressed in terms of "a
//!   chunk in the dataset," so each builds its own minimal fixture. T1d/T6b are
//!   the UNSIGNED directed forgery/downgrade attacks (undetected by design);
//!   T1f/T6c are their SIGNED counterparts, detected via
//!   `clawhdf5-format::verify_signed_root` (P2.4). T1e is the second-preimage /
//!   node-as-leaf domain-separation regression.
